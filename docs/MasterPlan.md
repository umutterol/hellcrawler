## Architecture Decisions Log

| Date | Decision | Rationale |
|------|----------|-----------|
| Dec 2024 | No screen shake | Designer preference |
| Dec 2024 | Tank is stationary | Core design pillar |
| Dec 2024 | Near Death not Death | Core design pillar |
| Dec 2024 | Auto-mode has 10% penalty | Balance manual vs idle play |
| Dec 2024 | Sliding Panel UI (not scenes) | Desktop Heroes reference - game never pauses, idle-first |
| Dec 2024 | 4 panels: Tank, Inventory, Shop, Settings | Covers all player needs without clutter |
